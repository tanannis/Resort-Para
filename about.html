        <p>Among luxurious resorts in Paradise Island, few offer a sense of warmth like us. With 140 guest rooms and 154 suites (most with private balconies, which is practically unheard of in the island), we’re the perfect choice for a business trip or romantic getaway to Paradise Island. With a chic and sophisticated décor highlighted by vintage furnishings and modern facilities, our lobby offers a calming retreat from the bustle of the island.

        <p>From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed by the friendliest front staff. I have stayed in hotels all over the world ranging from no stars to 5 stars and have never been treated so well. The resort itself is full of mystery and fun. It is beautiful, clean, and conveniently located to pretty much anything you would like to do. If you are coming to Paradise Island, I cannot recommend this resort enough. PERFECT in every single way!!!!</p>

        <p>I am a designer and the design of this resort brought me great joy. The design is extraordinary with layers of context, history and artwork. They have actually published a hardcover book about the development of the design and a copy is in each guest room. The staffs are terrific, very attentive. You can walk everywhere from this great location right on a major beach. Loved it!!!</p>
